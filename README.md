# arduino-image-converter
WebPage-based image converter for Arduino platform formats.

## Usage
You can access it online on https://rawgit.com/mdvorak/arduino-image-converter/master/converter.html

Or feel free to copy the html file to your project to have it always available.

Works also offline, but doesn't look so great (css are not loaded) and clipboard integration is not there.
